ReadMe for Running the Team Page Locally

Overview

This document explains how to set up and run the "Team Page" project locally on your machine. The page is built with HTML, CSS (using TailwindCSS), and JavaScript.

Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

Git: For cloning the repository.

A Code Editor: (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

A Web Browser: For viewing the page locally.

Steps to Run the Page Locally

1. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

Run the following command to clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the Git repository.

2. Navigate to the Project Folder

Change your working directory to the project folder:

cd <repository-folder>

Replace <repository-folder> with the name of the folder created after cloning the repository.

3. Open the Project in a Code Editor

Use your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) to open the project folder. For Visual Studio Code:

code .

4. Start a Live Server (Optional but Recommended)

To view the page locally, you can start a live server. If you're using Visual Studio Code:

Install the Live Server extension (if not already installed).

Right-click on index.html in the file explorer and select "Open with Live Server".

Alternatively, you can open the index.html file directly in a web browser, though some dynamic functionality may not work as intended.

5. Verify the Setup

Once the page is opened in your browser, verify that:

The layout and styling are rendered correctly.

The navigation menu works as expected, including the hamburger menu for smaller screens.

The team member cards display the correct images and hover effects.

Project Structure

The main files of the project include:

index.html: The main HTML file for the page.

scripts.js: Contains the JavaScript logic for interactivity (e.g., hamburger menu, smooth scrolling).

Images/: A folder containing images for team members.

README.md: This documentation file.

TailwindCSS Configuration

The project uses a CDN for TailwindCSS. Ensure that you have a stable internet connection to load the styles. TailwindCSS is included via this <script> tag in the HTML:

<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

Common Issues

Hamburger Menu Not Working:

Ensure the scripts.js file is correctly linked and contains the JavaScript logic.

Missing Images:

Verify that the Images/ folder exists and contains the correct image files with matching names.

Styling Issues:

Check your internet connection as TailwindCSS is loaded via a CDN.
